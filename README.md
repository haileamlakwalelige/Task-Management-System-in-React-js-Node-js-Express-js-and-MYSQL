# Task-Management-System-in-React-js-Node-js-Express-js-and-MYSQL


Here is a better way to write it:

This app is a task management system developed using ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MySQL.
To run the application from the front-end, use #npm start. To run the backend of the application, use "node" and 
#npm start. 
If you want to use nodemon, then run it using 
#npm run dev
